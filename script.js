// You’re going to store the gameboard as an array inside of a Gameboard object


// Your players are also going to be stored in objects

// you’re probably going to want an object to control the flow of the game itself.


// Your main goal here is to have as little global code as possible. Try tucking everything away inside of a module or factory.
// Rule of thumb: if you only ever need ONE of something (gameBoard, displayController), use a module.If you need multiples of something (players!), create them with factories.
